# Vision Patron

Vision Patron is a utility designed for the **$VISION** token that enables communities to connect and thrive **onchain**. With Vision Patron, users can create their own communities, receive $VISION donations from supporters (patrons), and engage with their patrons in a meaningful and decentralized manner.

## What is $VISION?

$VISION is the core utility token of the Vision ecosystem. It powers various features and utilities within the platform, including Vision Patron.

## What is Onchain Patron?

Onchain Patron is the primary feature of the Vision platform, designed to bring communities onchain. Users can create their own communities and receive $VISION donations from patrons who wish to support their work. Community owners have the flexibility to set a minimum donation amount required for access, control their community's announcements, and offer exclusive utilities and benefits to their patrons.

## Key Features

- **Create a Community**: Any user can create a community on Patron and start receiving $VISION donations. There is no fee to create a community, and each community shares the same profile.
- **Become a Patron**: Users can donate $VISION to support any community on the platform. By becoming a patron, you gain access to the community and any exclusive content or benefits the owner chooses to provide.
- **Onchain Records**: Every donation is recorded onchain, ensuring transparency and ownership. As a patron, youâ€™ll also receive an NFT to mark your contribution to the community.

## How It Works

1. **Donate $VISION**: Any user can send $VISION tokens to a wallet or basename on the platform to become a patron. Once the transaction is complete, you officially gain access to the community.
2. **Access Communities**: Patrons can explore and access the communities they've supported through the "Communities" menu.
3. **Support Creators**: Patronage is a way to support your favorite artists, content creators, and builders. The benefits of being a patron depend on what each community owner offers.
4. **NFT Patron**: By patronazing a community, you also receive a special NFT that recognizes your patronage.
5. **Lotteries**: Patrons can "roll" their NFTs in lotteries to win $VISION prizes up to 1000x the pool value. The luck of an NFT is defined by [(normalized user reputation + normalized community reputation) / 2]

## Creating a Community

- You can create your own community by visiting the "Communities" section on Patron and clicking the "Create My Community" button.
- Community creation is currently free, and each wallet can create one community.
- Community names are tied to your **BASE ONCHAIN IDENTITY**, meaning you can use your wallet address or basename, but custom names are not supported.
